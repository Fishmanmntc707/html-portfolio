<h1>Favourite Albums of the moment</h1>
<h2>my selections of the present in no particular order...</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Piquenique - Ed Motta</h3>
<p>
    What will most likely be a forever favorite love the jovial electronica leaning production. Much less heavy handed than other of his offerings in this current century. Playful and lighthearted harkening back to earlier years when the party never seemed to stop. Feels like a sunny day in it's best moments.</p>
    
    <h4>Highlights:</h4>
        <p>
        "Pe na Jaca"<br />
        "A Turma de Pilantragem"
        </p>
   <h4>Skippable:</h4>
        <p>"Carencia no Frio"</p>

        <h3>Lightn Up - Minako Yoshida</h3>
<p>
    From the moment one hits play Minako sweeps the listener up into a cinematic sonic journey full of richly detailed energetic and vividly textured arrangements that uplift the spirit just as the title suggests. A well balanced record in terms of dynamics containing higher energy moments dance floor oriented offerings such as the opening track contrasting with more tender material on some of the later tracks it has very well thought out pacing without a dull moment.

    "頬に夜の灯"<br />
    "Love Shower"<br />
    "風"<br />
    "Alcoholler"<br />

<h3>Sunken Condos - Donald Fagen</h3>
<p>
    Although all offerings from the Don will never fail to excite me this one has been on the mind as of late. Described as "less serious" by the man himself it does not dissapoint nor lack any of the sophistication of his other offerings although this may reveal itself only after many repeat listens. The cool is ever present in all of the sly but snide lyricism often focusing on the dapper ageing bachelor still trying to play the game. the songs are all beautifully crafted exhibiting the prime musicianship that is the territory of an elder jazz/pop/rock statesman such as Mr. Fagen another album lacking in nothing excepting dull moments.

<h4>Highlights:</h4>
"Slinky Thing"<br />
"Miss Marlene"<br />
"Good Stuff"<br />
